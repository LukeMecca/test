<p class="has-medium-font-size">   This was taken May 13, 2023, at an Airbnb on lake Erie. It was (as you can see) an amazing sunset with a boat that was basically asking to have its photo taken.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">   This photo got a blue at the local fair with a possible state fair, but the fair has a limit to two photos per person that can go to state fair and I had two others that went instead. Those two others are later in the list and labeled in the description  of the photos.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">This picture was taken August 29, 2022, in my backyard. It was seen by a family member and I was soon notified. So out I went in the drizzling rain with my camera and an umbrella. I took hundreds of photos while it flew around from spot to spot. Finally, it landed in a good spot and I took this gem of a photo.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To top it off, this was the second of the two photos to go to state fair this year. But instead of getting a red at state fair, this one got a perfect score and a purple ribbon.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">This one, as the name suggests, was taken at lake Erie on February 20, 2023, just like the last one. Again, the story wasn&#8217;t as good as the edit. The original photo had no left side rail and I had to add it in post using the rail on the right. To add to the difficulty of making the rail, the right rail is in the sun and the left is not, I had to remove highlights and fix shadows.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I almost forgot, this was one of the ones that went to state fair. Even though I thought that the sunset one was better this one, this went and got a red because the judge said that they liked it more without the edited rail for symmetry.</p>
