It was seen by a family member and I was soon notified. So out I went in the drizzling rain with my camera and an umbrella. I took hundreds of photos while it flew around from spot to spot. Finally, it landed in a good spot and I took this gem of a photo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">To top it off, this was the second of the two photos to go to state fair this year. But instead of getting a red at state fair, this one got a perfect score and a purple ribbon.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/luke.mecca1.net\/2023\/10\/13\/snowy-owl\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3888\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_2110-fair.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-57\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This is one of my favorites, it was taken on April 21, 2022. It was seen out the window and across a field on a day with plenty of April showers. Just like the Red Tailed Hawk I went out in the light sprinkle to get this, only this time I had a cloth and no umbrella.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This photo got a state fair blue at the 2022 fair<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/luke.mecca1.net\/2023\/10\/13\/ladybug\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2732\" height=\"2049\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_2310-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-58\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This picture was taken May 6, 2022.
