It was (as you can see) an amazing sunset with a boat that was basically asking to have its photo taken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This photo got a blue at the local fair with a possible state fair, but the fair has a limit to two photos per person that can go to state fair and I had two others that went instead. Those two others are later in the list and labeled in the description of the photos.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/luke.mecca1.net\/2023\/10\/13\/red-tailed-hawk\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3888\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_4199-fair-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-88\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This picture was taken August 29, 2022, in my backyard. It was seen by a family member and I was soon notified. So out I went in the drizzling rain with my camera and an umbrella. I took hundreds of photos while it flew around from spot to spot. Finally, it landed in a good spot and I took this gem of a photo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">To top it off, this was the second of the two photos to go to state fair this year. But instead of getting a red at state fair, this one got a perfect score and a purple ribbon.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/luke.mecca1.net\/2023\/10\/13\/snowy-owl\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3888\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_2110-fair.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-57\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This is one of my favorites, it was taken on April 21, 2022. It was seen out the window and across a field on a day with plenty of April showers. Just like the Red Tailed Hawk I went out in the light sprinkle to get this, only this time I had a cloth and no umbrella.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This photo got a state fair blue at the 2022 fair<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/luke.mecca1.net\/2023\/10\/13\/ladybug\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2732\" height=\"2049\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/IMG_2310-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-58\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This picture was taken May 6, 2022.
